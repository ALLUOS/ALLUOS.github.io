## Paper & Conference Talk

_Conference submission:_
In order to nicely wrap up all the improvements of Escapeling that were achieved throughout the second year of the project, we decided to write up these contributions as a paper. To publish the paper, we submitted a session proposal to the [Learning Ideas Conference 2022](https://www.learningideasconf.org/) - the conference where the paper written by the previous cohort of the Escapeling team was also submitted to (Johnson, Zanoli and Urazov, 2020). More specifically, we submitted a short abstract proposing a 30-minute talk consisting of a presentation and demo elements from Escapeling. The proposal was submitted to a special track of the conference â€“ the [ALICE special track](https://www.learningideasconf.org/alice). This is because the focus of the special track matches our application and our reported improvements particularly well, concentrating on chatbots, gamification and technology in online education. The proposal was preliminarily accepted, contingent on the acceptance of the full paper submitted by March 15th 2022.
