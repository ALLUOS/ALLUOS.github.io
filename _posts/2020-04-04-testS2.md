##### Personalized Learning Outcome Post-Tests

To gauge if the application has affected individual user's language skills we employ a learning outcome post-test strategy involving personalized langauge skill assessments. As mentioned in the [Adaptive Data]() section, the application periodically collects various user performance metadata which are used both to adjust application difficulty and to inform the aforementioned learning outcome post-test. Given the application's adaptive learning strategy, it is difficult to design a post-test of language skill which can assumedly be compared across all participants in a controlled manner. In light of this, we use the performance metadata to automatically generate personalized skill assessments which aim to, for each participant, test whether items which proved particularly challenging during application use can be successfully answered.

For example, the [sentence correction]() task is scored according to the number of task iteration phases which are successfully passed. This allows us to rank users' task iterations by their retrospective challenge, assuming that task iterations with lower scores were more challenging for a student. We then present these task items to the student during the learning outcome post-test. Likewise, we also present customized post-test tasks for the [vocabulary guessing]() task, incorporating user-generated descriptions to achieve a matching task following the methodology of [#]. The image below shows an example of such generated vocabulary matching questions.
