Escapeling is currently equipped with two support functionalities to assist users during their game experience: an `/faq` command and a `/tutorial` command. Read more to find out how these two features were conceptualized and implemented.

When evaluating feedback received by various users of our application, we realized that some elements of Escapeling’s game experience weren’t entirely clear to first time users, especially when it came to some crucial aspects of the Telegram framework it relies on. Therefore, we decided to put together a tutorial that would provide guidance, if requested. More specifically, we prepared a script for two distinct tutorials: a) one shows how to get started with Escapeling, b) the other shows how to approach the group tasks. This partition corresponds to the two main modes of interaction with our app, namely a) in a private chat with the [Escapeling bot](https://telegram.me/Escapeling_Bot), and b) in a group chat with other users. The images below show an example of what this looks like inside the app.

To support these new functionalities, we introduced two new conversation handlers, one for each feature. These conversation handlers are triggered within the chat by using the `/faq` command and the `/tutorial` command, respectively. Once triggered, the conversation handlers will prompt the users with a poll of options. If an option is chosen, messages are sent to elaborate on the issue the user inquires about (see Figure 3 for an example). Subsequently, the user gets to choose whether to continue asking other questions (i.e. get the same poll again) or to return to the game.

Both the FAQ and the tutorial functionalities are available in the dyadic conversation (between the bot and a single user) as well as in the escape missions (in the game group chats). 

The scripts needed for these support functionalities are stored as `.json` files under:
* `data/phrases/faq_questions.json`
* `data/phrases/tutorial_questions.json`
