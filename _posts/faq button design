## FAQ button design
Over the course of the project, the Escapeling team has been eager to make the bot transparent to the user. 
While the bot structure and code were becoming more user-friendly due to the implementation team efforts, 
we could still afford more user experience improvements.
Since Escapeling is an autonomous Telegram bot, it was lacking the general welcoming message, permanent support of the tech team, 
and it left no opportunity for the user to request any clarifications in case issues or questions arose. 
In order to present the very idea of Escapeling game as well as explain the basic
‘how-to’ details to the new user, the design team has created the FAQ button. 
The FAQ button is a segment of the Escapeling supporting site as well as a command within the bot that allows the user 
to learn about the idea behind the project and its limitations, 
task content and specifications, general instructions and a list of potential technical problems.
The FAQ button is a section that is open to constant updating and edits, which are natural to appear as the project evolves. 
By the end of the third project term we have collected some precise but elaborate answers to the most frequent and challenging questions 
that the user could have, as well as comments about the developed tasks, technical regulations and the general goal of the project per se.
