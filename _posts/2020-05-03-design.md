### Summary of functional requirements
In summary, the chat bot should provide functionality for a group interaction in which 15 to 16 year old students (language level B1) can train their communication skills in the English language outside of a school setting. This requires that users can form and/ or join groups of up to four members when using the application. Generally, the chat bot should in its interaction with the users use language and task descriptions that match the B1 language level of the target group. Additionally, gamefication is included in the design of the application. The chat bot needs to track users' progress in solving the tasks and provide them with clear feedback and rewards when tasks are successfully completed to further motivate and engage them. Once the group has been formed the application needs to allow users to chose one of the two developed tasks.

Detailed functional requirements follow from the in-depth description of the two developed tasks provided above. For both tasks it is necessary that each user is chosen in turn as the main active user, who either attempts to correct the sentence (task one) or provides a description for the current word (task two). This means that the application needs to track which users have already performed the task in any given round and select a new user for each turn. The application should model users' skill level for relevant language components: vocabulary (trained through task two) and grammar (trained through task one). Each of these broad language components is represented through a set of specific sub-skills. Performing the tasks should train some of these sub-skills and the application needs to monitor individual and group level skills to adequately chose a task difficulty. Additionally, each task has specific functional requirements necessary to provide an adequate user experience.

For task one the chat bot should guide users through the individual parts of the task (identifying error and correcting it) to ensure that users understand what is expected of them. Once a user attempts to solve a part of the task the application should provide immediate feedback and if necessary corrections so that the user can learn the correct solution to the task.

The second task requires that the bot chooses a new word from the list of available words which the active user should explain in the chat. If a user is tasked with explaining a word they do not know they need the option to chose a different word. This means that in providing a word to explain to a user the application additionally should provide the option to reject this word. The application should detect the use of the to-be-explained word in the chat by the user who is supposed to explain it in order to prevent this basic form of cheating in the task. The bot should in such a case mark the task as incorrectly answered. In case one of the other users correctly guesses the word the application needs to detect the solution in the chat and mark the round in the task as solved.
