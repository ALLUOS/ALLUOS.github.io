The team behind Escapeling is a group of students, so we are constantly looking to improve the efficacy of Escapeling's methods.

Escapeling is a project that was created and is led entirely by university students. We have no interest in collecting, selling or using your data for anything other than playing this game.
Please be aware that even though we do not collect this information, we are able to see your chat history while playing the game. Therefore we kindly ask you not to write any personal information in any chats with the bot.</div>

## Tasks

Learn the specifics of the different language practice tasks our application currently offers.

<details>
  <summary class="FAQ"><b>What is the sentence correction task?</b></summary>

<div class="FAQ">In this task you focus on finding grammatical mistakes. You will each get a sentence and the goal is to determine whether it is grammatically correct or incorrect. If the sentence is incorrect, you should find the mistake and provide a correct alternative for it. There is always only one word that needs to be corrected. Importantly, you are allowed to discuss the given sentence in the group chat. However, only you are responsible for giving a final answer if it's your turn. Everyone will get a turn.</div>

</details>

<details>
  <summary class="FAQ"><b>What is the vocabulary guessing task?</b></summary>

<div class="FAQ">This task is designed to enhance vocabulary knowledge. During the task, each user is given a word, and the goal is to describe its meaning without using the word itself. The goal of the other people in the group is to guess it. In case a person doesnâ€™t know the meaning of the word given to them, there is an option to choose an alternative word. There is a time limit on each word guess. The turn ends if the word was guessed correctly or when the time runs out.</div>

</details>

<details>
  <summary class="FAQ"><b>What is the discussion task?</b></summary>

<div class="FAQ">The goal of the discussion task is to practice language production and writing skills. For this reason, you are given a short text. The topic of the text should start and guide a discussion between group members. After the text, you will receive some discussion questions. There are three questions in total, and you will have a time limit to discuss each of them. Your task is to share your opinions about the given topic in the group chat. Try to write and interact as much as possible.</div>

</details>

<details>
  <summary class="FAQ"><b>I think my answer was right, but the bot says I was wrong.</b></summary>

<div class="FAQ">In designing the existing tasks, we focused on trusted sources, such as datasets and language corpora. However, there is always a possibility that there are multiple correct answers to a question. Our materials have been revised to accomodate this possibility, but there might still be some issues. If you are certain that your answer is correct, please report it using the following link.</div>

  <summary class="FAQ"><b>I was prompted to go forward with the task by inserting the password but we haven't received any. What should I do?</b></summary>

<div class="FAQ">This is a known issue and we are working on fixing it. As a workaround, you can try restarting the bot from within the groupchat: type <code>/stop</code> and then <code>/start</code>. If this doesn't fix the issue, unfortunately the only way to continue playing is to create a whole new escape mission. This means going back to your chat with the Escapeling bot, typing <code>/start</code>, and either creating or joining a new group. You can invite the same people to join you again, but you will lose the progress you had made in the previous session.</div>
