# Video For basic Introduction and Explanation

Video could be an easier form to explain and show how the game works. We decided to create a video with a basic explanation of how each of the tasks could be completed, and showcase basic features like adaptive hints. We wanted to make the video short, descriptive and appealing for a viewer to try it out. Furthermore, we make the narrative of the video in such a way that it feels like an advertisement.
 We recorded ourselves playing the game starting from lobby to show how one can find partner to play the game. We also recorded each possible cases during each, like what happens when one fails the task, complete the task and gives wrong answers in between. This way, we can showcase the features of the game in each task.
