## Motivation 
During this last semester a discussion about the future for the conducted project arise, since there was a will to give the project and the project group the credit it is worth. The project group started to discuss what the actual goal was for the documentation and the coding of the project along with other relevant information. The conclusion for all of the project members was that there was a desire to make the project “alive”, in other words a will to make e.g., the bot and the documentation of the project easily accessible, so that there would be a possibility to be inspired by different parts of the project.

As of today, there is no IKW-webiste where different study projects can display information about the project work so the discussion landed in a working group, who got the assignment to investigate if there were an already existing IKW-website, how it was structured and if different improvement could be done. The project group wanted an attractive website that would be able to give inspiration to someone who might want to make their own proceeding of an already completed project.

## Structure of new website

In order to be able to improve the IKW-website we started to search for existing websites that we found more attractive and appealing, and landed in that the people section of the neuroinformatic research group at OUS was a website that we found attractive. Therefore, we started to break down the landing page of the neuroinformatic website, so that we could get an appreciation of how we wanted the new IKW-website to be structured. 

At the neuroinformatic website we pointed out different parts that we thought were of importance and could be implemented at the new website. For example, a box where there was room for an information section and a picture was considered as relevant for the new website. Since the existing IKW-website only consists of one box of information, we wanted the new website to have a more functional design where different boxes of information were displayed, in order to make the website more vivid. 
The structure of the new IKW-website is therefore mainly inspired by the neuroinformatic website at OUS.

## Motivation behind template

After stating the structure for the new website, we started to work on a template for making the re-designing of the website more efficient and to make it easier for different study groups to know what type of information they should address. To be able to construct a template, it felt necessary to state exactly what type of information that should be displayed at the website. Therefore, different target groups were established, in order to identify what type of information that was needed, for example one target group was prospective students that wants to inform themselves about previous or potential study projects. We used the what, who and how method and decided on different design aspects, such as that a group photo should be displayed, a section where the goal of the project is described and what the project already have achieved.
