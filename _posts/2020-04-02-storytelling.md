## Plot and storylines

(plot description)

In addition to the main storyline of the escape scenario, several session variants were designed. Each of these story variants consists of 4 blocks of text, in which the introduction and the conclusion stay the same as in the first storyline to keep the original setting and story frame. Meanwhile, the story in between differs with respect to the different escape rooms, the items to interact with, like a map, and the incidents, like a slipping team mate.

The story variants are created to keep the story engaging and interesting for users who have already interacted with the application but want to go on with their learning experience, even for those, who have already successfully escaped.

## Storyline delivery methods

The storytelling features described above are delivered to the users via a mix of textual, visual and audiovisual inputs.

Given its Telegram infrastructure, the default way to interact with the application is via text messages. The users begin their Escapeling journey by sending a simple /start message to the Telegram bot. Given this prompt, the bot is programmed to respond with an introduction to the Escapeling narrative. This introduction is delivered in the form of a second-person narration, beginning with the words “You regain consciousness and find yourself in a strange and unfamiliar place…”. See figure 1 to get a better sense of this first exchange with the bot.

A focal point of this introduction is the delivery of a short informative video. The purpose of this medium is to immerse the users in the narration by hearing the characters’ voices and getting glimpses of the spaceship they are trapped on. The video is narrated by Harriet, who introduces herself and explains the situation to the users. Click [here](https://youtu.be/qIMSD-m6QaM) to view the video in full.

As a whole, this short introductory sequence is delivered to each user individually when they first come in contact with the application. Afterwards, the game progresses in iterations of group sessions (see #structure). During these sessions, the bot has three main modes of interaction: a) as a second person narrator; b) as Harriet; c) as Elias. These different bot personas are distinguished through the use of emojis (see figure 2).

## Outlook

After two semesters of work on the project, we have achieved a satisfactory sketch of the narration, and the visual media we presented are effective in guiding users through an introduction to the application and the storyline.

In the future, our wish is to create a more immersive game experience by including more visual and audio-visual content throughout the whole application. Moreover, we hope to give users more agency by providing additional possibilities for interaction, both with the characters and with the game environment. Finally, we intend to devote more time and thought to the further development of a captivating and motivating storyline.
