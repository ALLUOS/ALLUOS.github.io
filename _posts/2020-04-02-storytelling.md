(plot description)

In addition to the main storyline of the escape scenario, several session variants were designed. Each of these story variants consists of 4 blocks of text, in which the introduction and the conclusion stay the same as in the first storyline to keep the original setting and story frame. Meanwhile, the story in between differs with respect to the different escape rooms, the items to interact with, like a map, and the incidents, like a slipping team mate.

The story variants are created to keep the story engaging and interesting for users who have already interacted with the application but want to go on with their learning experience, even for those, who have already successfully escaped.
