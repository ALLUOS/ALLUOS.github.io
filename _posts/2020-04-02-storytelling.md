## Motivation for the change in storytelling

Escapeling is an app for learning English as a foreign language, the main purpose of which is to provide the user with an opportunity for practice English skills with peers in a group format with the help of our app.

We would like to go away from boring scenarios and engage users throughout their language learning journey. Gamification of education is one of our main approaches, as we believe that it makes educational process more interesting and helps to keep users’ attention during task completion, especially in a group learning scenario, where all the users have to interact with each other in order to solve the task. That is why, there was made a decision to create a storyline, introduce characters and create different variants of the plot development.

In the summer semester’20 we chose a narrative scenario as one of the methods to make users learn a language effectively. According to this, escape scenario has been suggested, in which users are supposed to be abducted by Alien and escape by solving a few tasks together. Having solved each task correctly, users obtain a hint of the key that will help them. First of all, receiving a hint is a reward that helps to motivate users. Moreover, they can imagine at what point they are in the whole story and as they collect remaining hints, they will successfully complete the task.

In the winter semester’20/21 we decided to make some changes and additions into the existing concept, preserving the idea of escape room in the collaborative learning scenario, however, we made a decision to improve narrative, introduce new characters, create different versions of a single escapeling session and add more visual material.

At this point of time we designed three tasks that help users to improve their English level. We decided to introduce such a narrative that will create the impression that all the tasks are connected between each other. Furthermore, we added new characters (Harriet and Elias) to make the storytelling more logical and interesting. There was made a decision to create different versions of a single escapeling session in order to give users an opportunity to use an application for learning a few times, even if the tasks have already been successfully completed. What is more, the use of emojis, an introductory video and pictures help to avoid sending large text messages to the user that makes the interface of the app more user-friendly and the learning process more interesting as it immerse users into the atmosphere of the game.

## Characters

This semester we made a decision to introduce new characters into our storyline. This allows us to keep users interested throughout the whole learning process, as it brings new turns and makes learning of the English language more engaging. Moreover, it helped us to make the structure of the storytelling more logical and coherent. In this section we would like to introduce our main characters.

Aliens kidnapped four human beings from the Earth (a formed group of students) and put them on the alienship. Their plan is to take over the Earth, but for that then need to remove all the human beings that currently inhabit the Earth. Aliens managed to kidnap a few people and intend to interrogate them in order to find out the way how to remove people from the Earth and populate the Earth themselves.

Harriet is a human hacker from the Earth who manages to hack a signal from space and now she is on the line with users. She has to save humans and prevent the threat of human extinction. Harriet cannot allow aliens to remove people from Earth and populate the planet completely. But at first she has to make sure that those who are in contact with her now are really humans. Harriet agrees to send the escape codes as soon as a group, that Harriet communicating with, successfully fulfils the tasks only humans can solve, in particular language tasks. Successful task completion helps to identify who on the line with the hacker are, and Harriet sends the escape code for humans.

Elias is a sympathetic alien who accompanies humans during their stay on the spaceship and guides users through the tasks. He is trustworthy and always ready to help. Some time ago he lived on the Earth and there learned one human language. He likes human beings and wants to assist to stop the evil plan of other aliens, that is why he helps humans to escape.

## Plot and storylines

One of our goals this semester was to improve the storyline in such a way that it could serve as additional motivation for the participants to get engaged in activities proposed by the chatbot. Thus, first of all, existing narrative ideas should be organised into a united plot. Secondly, the storyline should be better integrated with the existing tasks and give the users a sense of progression as they successfully move from one task to another. Thirdly, additional story variants should be created.

The main storyline can be described as follows. The users regain consciousness and find themselves in a strange and unfamiliar place. They find out then that they are on a spaceship, while aliens, who kidnapped them, now want to interrogate them to figure out a way to remove all humans from the Earth. This makes it clear that the final goal of the participants should be an escape from the spaceship, which is possible only with the help of two additional characters: Elias and Harriet.

We motivate the importance of linguistic tasks within described narrative by emphasizing that English language is a perfect tool to provide evidence that participants are proficient in one of the most spoken languages on the planet and, thus, are humans and not the aliens. Only this can persuade hacker from the Earth to help them.

Storyblocks and tasks are combined in such a way that successful completion of each task leads to the users obtaining a piece of the code that will let them continue the quest. The storyline consists of introduction, conclusion and two intermediate story blocks that are presented in-between the tasks. In case the task was failed, a respectful story block gets presented asking if the users would like to do the task one more time. If all three tasks were completed, the story session ends with the users escaping the spaceship on a shuttle they manage to find. If participants fail the last task, they get captured by the aliens and can only start their escape from the very beginning.

In addition to the main storyline of the escape scenario, several session variants were designed. Each of these story variants consists of 4 blocks of text, in which the introduction and the conclusion stay the same as in the first storyline to keep the original setting and story frame. Meanwhile, the story in between differs with respect to the different escape rooms, the items to interact with, like a map, and the incidents, like a slipping team mate.

The story variants are created to keep the story engaging and interesting for users who have already interacted with the application but want to go on with their learning experience, even for those, who have already successfully escaped.

## Block Structure


The structure of the story was divided into blocks. This was done in order to integrate the story with the tasks that are to be completed by the participants. The block is the representation of the stage of the escape the participants are in. The story right now is based on 5 blocks which allows the participants to take part in 3 tasks before they finish the learning process. The block flowchart basically shows the flow of the blocks and the blocks which are completed, and which are not.
The blocks that are completed:
1)	Introduction (Block 1)
2)	Before Task 1 (Block 2)
3)	Between Task 1-2 (Block 3)
4)	Between Task 2-3 (Block 4)
5)	Conclusion Escape (Block 5)


The Blocks that are to be implemented in the coming semester:
1)	Before task 4 (Block 6)
2)	Before task 5 (Block 7)

The signs that are denoting Success Message and Failure Message in other words are messages from the Elias and/or Harriet whether the participants have successful completed their tasks or not and the further steps to be taken in each case. The participants will be participating the different task before block 3, 4 and 5. After every completion of the task further steps would be indicated and the final escape is possible at block 5.
	Keeping in mind the Adaptive learning module and the possibilities of task list being increased we have devised a flow in such a way that allows the expansion of more blocks before the participants can escape. This would mean that the participants will have to take part in more than 3 tasks in a session. For now, we have shown 2 more block which indicates that the participants will have to do 5 tasks and not 3 to escape. This gives the participants the option to escape after 3 escapes or do 2 more tasks. In this case they do not have to start a new session and start with the introduction block all over again.

### Block Description

This section we will talk about what every block will describes and what stage of story we are in during the sessions.

#### Block 1
Is the introduction block. This block covers the overall plot and the backstory. It gives the basic understanding of the storyline to the participants. The summary of what is included in the introduction block is:
The users of our app are a part of the group of humans who was tricked into joining the aliens on one of their spaceships. They thought they would be entering into a collaboration with the aliens, but they realized they’ve been tricked. Now, they must find their way out of the spaceship
Also, Block 1 is presented to the participants in their personal chats. And all other blocks are in the groups joined by the participants.
#### Block 2
Block two is the interactions of the 2 bot characters, which are a part of the storyline, with the participants. The two bot personas are:
1)	Sympathetic Alien: Elias – He is the guide and the spokesperson for the adaptive learning module. He basically helps in adjusting the difficulty level of the task based on the participants performance. He is also responsible for taking feedback.
2)	Hacker from Earth: Harriet – She is the Tester and task conductor to assess if they are humans or not.
The basic concept of the block 2 is to introduce them to the idea of doing tasks in order to escape. The participants start their first task after this block. A sample message from Harriet would look like:
		"Alright! However, at first, I must check whether you are really humans, not aliens, in order not to put humanity under the threat. In order to prove that you are humans you must complete a few tasks and prove your English knowledge. After successful completion, you’ll get a code to escape”
#### Block 3 and 4
Block 3 and 4 are block which are between task. These blocks depend on the result of the performance of the participants in the previous task. There are 2 possibilities after finishing the tasks are failure or success. The outcomes of the tasks has the following outputs:
1) Failure: A message from Harriet regarding how she cannot give the password to the participant and better luck next time.
2) Success (if the task is completed successfully): A message from Harriet to move forward to other task and a suggestion from Elias in respect to the adaptive module.
#### Conclusion block
The Conclusion block is the final block where the participants realizes whether they can escape or not. Basically, whether the participants have successfully finished all the tasks in the session. The two possibilities after finishing the task is:
1) Success: "Congratulations! You have taken the last step on the path to escape. I was glad to meet you, human friends, but it's time to say goodbye” Message from Harriet
2) Failure: "I'm sure there is still hope! You can start your escape again” Message from Elias

## Storyline delivery methods

The storytelling features described above are delivered to the users via a mix of textual, visual and audiovisual inputs.

Given its Telegram infrastructure, the default way to interact with the application is via text messages. The users begin their Escapeling journey by sending a simple /start message to the Telegram bot. Given this prompt, the bot is programmed to respond with an introduction to the Escapeling narrative. This introduction is delivered in the form of a second-person narration, beginning with the words "You regain consciousness and find yourself in a strange and unfamiliar place…”. See figure 1 to get a better sense of this first exchange with the bot.

<img src="https://github.com/ALLUOS/ALLUOS.github.io/blob/9b38a671bf4e6083b1d299d72c4f4168f60b07af/assets/images/StorytellingFig01.png" alt="Figure 2: First exchange with the bot" width="700">

*Figure 2: First exchange with the bot*

A focal point of this introduction is the delivery of a short informative video. The purpose of this medium is to immerse the users in the narration by hearing the characters’ voices and getting glimpses of the spaceship they are trapped on. The video is narrated by Harriet, who introduces herself and explains the situation to the users. Click [here](https://youtu.be/qIMSD-m6QaM) to view the video in full.

As a whole, this short introductory sequence is delivered to each user individually when they first come in contact with the application. Afterwards, the game progresses in iterations of group sessions (see #structure). During these sessions, the bot has three main modes of interaction: a) as a second person narrator; b) as Harriet; c) as Elias. These different bot personas are distinguished through the use of emojis (see figure 2).

## Outlook

After two semesters of work on the project, we have achieved a satisfactory sketch of the narration, and the visual media we presented are effective in guiding users through an introduction to the application and the storyline.

In the future, our wish is to create a more immersive game experience by including more visual and audio-visual content throughout the whole application. Moreover, we hope to give users more agency by providing additional possibilities for interaction, both with the characters and with the game environment. Finally, we intend to devote more time and thought to the further development of a captivating and motivating storyline.
