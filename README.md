## Documentation for 'Adaptive Language Learning' Study Project @UOS

---

### Overview

This repository hosts the resources for a static-site generated by GitHub pages and Jekyll. The site is intended as a landing page for the project and a host for the project documentation resources. As such, the generated site contains both marketing-style information and detailed documentation. The documentation alone is the responsibility of project members.

### Structure

The documentation is tentatively structured as follows:

<pre>
|-- Overview (Christian) ~750 words
    |-- Introduction to the project.

|-- Summary and Evaluation (Group 3) ~2000 words
    |-- Test strategy overview.
    |-- Evaluation. Based on tests, was the application accepted by the target user and did it meet the requirements?
    |-- Summary. General reflection on the applications successes/failures.
    |-- Outlook. Next steps and suggested changes for semester two.
</pre>

### Requirements

Each group must submit the raw text for their sections as plain text by 30.08. Christian will then format the text and publish the site by the end of September.

---

### Usage

As the site is deployed by GitHub Pages and generated with a Jekyll integration, we do not need to install Ruby or mess with css, we can directly modify Markdown files and quickly see the results on our site. As stated, group members are only responsible for the raw text/images of their documentation sections, but if you would like to modify the site template please raise this issue during a group meeting and we will implement a workflow to facilitate this change.

This GitHub pages site is based off the free template 'Spectral,' created by HTML5 UP and Andrew Banchich.
