## Documentation for 'Adaptive Language Learning' Study Project @UOS

### Note for Semester Three

All structural additions and notes relevant to the documentation
for the project's second semester are **emboldened** with an
[S3] tag.

----

### Overview

This repository hosts the resources for a static-site generated by GitHub pages and Jekyll.
The site is intended as a landing page for the project and a host for the project documentation resources.
As such, the generated site contains both marketing-style information and detailed documentation.
The documentation alone is the responsibility of project members.

### Submission Guidelines

Each group is responsible for the above-delegated section and each member must contribute an appropriate number of words for his/her project commitment.
Study project participants should contribute approximately 750 words each. Interdisciplinary participants should contribute approximately 500 words each.
Each group must create a new repository branch **from the semester_two feature branch** and collaboratively finish their section. By **15 August 2021** each group must submit a pull request to merge their
branch with the **semester_three** branch and include in the pull request a comment which details the approximate word-count contributions of each project member. The pull
requests will then be reviewed and merged. The final site will then be collectively reviewed before grading submission at the end of March.

### Grading Guidelines

Submitted Documentation (50)
- approx 500 words interdisciplinary, 750 words study project
- Formal aspects (length, scientific language, consistent formatting, proper referencing, good use of figures, screenshots etc.) (20)
- Clear description of implementation/conception/results (20)
- Discussion of limitations, possible additions (10)

### Usage

As the site is deployed by GitHub Pages and generated with a Jekyll integration, we do not need to install Ruby or mess with css, we can directly modify Markdown files and quickly see the results on our site.
As stated, group members are only responsible for the raw text/images of their documentation sections,
but if you would like to modify the site template please raise this issue during a group meeting and we will implement a workflow to facilitate this change.
